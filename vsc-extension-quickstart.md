# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the extension code and specifies the commands and menu items provided by the extension.
* `extension.js` - this is the main file that contains the extension code.
* `converter.py` - this is the Python script that performs the Chinese conversion.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Select some Chinese text in the editor.
* Right-click to see the context menu with conversion options.
* Choose "Convert to Simplified Chinese" or "Convert to Traditional Chinese".

## Make changes

* Make changes to the code in `extension.js` or `converter.py`.
* Reload the extension window (Developer: Reload Window) or press `Ctrl+R` (`Cmd+R` on Mac) to see the changes.

## Install your extension

* To start using your extension with VS Code, press `F5` and run the extension.
* Alternatively, you can package your extension into a `.vsix` file using `vsce package` command (install vsce via `npm install -g vsce`).
